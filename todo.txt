- Need to add some questions, rules and tie them together
- Inference engine will cycle through the rules and answers and based on answers will select a phone
- Need to add more phones in the 'phones.json' format
- Questions should also be in JSON format
- Need to add GUI
    - Ask user for name
    - Display questions
    - Display final answer and explanation as to why
    - Maybe allow users to add rules on the fly (Not required but would be nice)
    - Allow user to see all rules and answers (not necessary)
